[Floating UI](https://floating-ui.com) is a small library that helps you create
"floating" elements such as tooltips, popovers, dropdowns, and more.

It offers two main features:

1. **Anchor positioning**: Anchor a floating element (such as a tooltip) to
   another element (such as a button) while simultaneously ensuring it stays in
   view as best as possible by avoiding collisions. This feature is available
   for all platforms.
2. **User interactions for React**: Hooks and components for composing
   interactions to create accessible floating UI components.


```shell
yarn install solid-floating-ui
```

### Testing grounds

## Credits

Thanks to [@skeletonlabs](https://github.com/skeletonlabs/floating-ui-svelte) for their svelte port of floating-ui, which I could then convert to solidjs as the basis for this library.
